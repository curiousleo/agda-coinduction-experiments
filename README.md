Infinite data structures in Agda
================================

At the [Midlands Graduate School 2015](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/G.Struth/mgs2015/mgs.html), Venanzio Capretta gave a series of lectures and exercise classes on infinite data structures, giving implementations in Haskell and Coq (the lecture notes and source code files are available [on his website](http://www.duplavis.com/venanzio/)).

Some of the students who attended Venanzio's course wondered what the data structures and algorithms would look like in Agda. This repository contains what we cooked up.
